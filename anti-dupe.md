# 1 How can we ensure that each card is received once and only once?

We can assign a unique ID to track each card through the exchange process. Each node can record the id of each card they received and determine if they have received it before so each node can block that duplicate message. Also, we can select an intermediate node that all cards need to send through this node before sending to the recipient so that this node can record the card's id and block the card if it is a duplicate card. Besides, all unique cards that pass through the intermediate node will be assigned to a new same id, so the recipient can also identify which card belongs to which message.
