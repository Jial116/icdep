## How can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?
As each node has been assigned a unique identification number in the previous question, we can add a destination field to the card and use the id to specify the destination.
